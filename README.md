## About
Viewcon was, for me, a chance to challenge myself into learning something
I was not sure I could do. It is an augmented reality app that could be useful at large conventions.
A marker could be placed outside of each breakout room and information could be updated remotely
or changed depending on the user. 

In the making of the app I tried several technologies and settled on one that works on the internet. 
The idea is that users will not have to download any content, making it a non-invasive technology.
For added convenience I used a phone number rather than a url. because phone numbers are easier to remember.
The user sends a text message and then receives a message with a link to the app. the user then clicks the link
and gives their browser permission to use their phone camera and when the camera os pointed at the marker
the marker is replaced with relevant information.

## Note: Due to Apple's security policies HTML5 is unable to access Apple devices cameras at the time of writing this.
